### Description:
<p align="justify"> This dashboard combines Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive, and Prescriptive Analysis. Out of 4,981 people surveyed, 248 suffered from stroke, 275 from heart disease, and 479 from hypertension. The female population is more likely to suffer from hypertension and stroke, while males tend to be more prone to heart disease. Being married or smoking also increases the risk of these conditions. The diagram shows that age and Body Mass Index are strongly correlated with all three diseases.</p>
